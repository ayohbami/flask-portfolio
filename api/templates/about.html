<h1 class="text-secondary" align="">About Me</h1>
<p>
  Are you eager to hear a
  <strong class="bg-dark rounded">story of transformation?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Allow me to introduce myself - I'm commonly known as
  <strong class="bg-dark rounded">"Danny"</strong>, an aspiring Python
  Developer. However, my journey to this career has been anything but ordinary.
</p>

<p>
  For over a decade, I worked as a Chartered Accountant. But as time went by, I became increasingly captivated by the dynamic and inventive realm of software development.
</p>
<p>
  I unearthed a passion for problem-solving, logical thinking, and the adaptability of Python as a programming language. Through Python, I found the
  chance to contribute to projects that improved businesses decision making, and Ivrealized that this was the next step in my professional career.
</p>
<p>
  So, even in my early 30s, I bravely chose to take a leap of faith and
  transition into a new career of finding solution to specific finance and technology problems. It has been one of the most rewarding but also challenging periods in my carerr, and wouldn't want it any other way.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I'm on a mission to create solutions that make a difference, utilizing my skills and expertise in Finance and Python.
